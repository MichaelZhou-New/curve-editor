Hello! :) 

You can open my assignment in Visual Studio, just like the boilerplate code and it should be just fine! 

- The most important command is K - this switches from the curve editor to the 3D viewer. 

In the curve editor:

	- The curve editor has the Y-axis at it's center, so asymmetric curves should not intersect the vertical middle. (produces some cool shapes if you do this, tho)
	- Press (and hold) TAB to select a point near the mouse to edit  (will not select if not close), and move your mouse to change it's position. 
	- Left click to add a point at the location of the cursor.
	- Right click to delete the point nearest to the cursor. 
	- Press (and hold) W to zoom in.
	- Press (and hold) S to zoom out.
	- Press C to clear the curve, starting new with only a new point at the origin (move this using TAB + mouse as desired).
	- Press B to switch between Bezier and B-Spline curves (default is Bezier).

In the 3D viewer: (will lock your mouse until you switch back to the curve editor)

	Camera controls:
	- Move the mouse to change where the camera is facing.
	- Press (and hold) W to move the camera forward.
	- Press (and hold) S to move the camera backwards.
	- Press (and hold) A to move the camera left.
	- Press (and hold) D to move the camera right.

	Scene controls:
	- Press J to toggle between wireframe and fill. (default is fill)
	- Press 1 (one) to view the object generated by the Surface of Revolution of the curve in the curve editor. (default 3D scene) 
	- Press 2 to view the first tensor product surface generated by my code 
	- Press 3 to view the second tensor product surface generated by my code
	- Note that the tensor product surfaces have some randomness, so these curves will be different from execution to execution.
	- While viewing a surface (after pressing 2 or 3):
		- Press P to toggle whether or not the control points for the surface are drawn. (default is off)
		- Press B to toggle whether Bezier or B-Spline subdivision is used (same as whichever is used in curve editor).

This is both one of the longest, but coolest assignments I've done in uni :')))

Thanks!
